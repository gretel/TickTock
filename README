This is an EXTREMELY simple little stopwatch class. You can measure wall-clock durations in two ways:

TickTock.start();
doSomeWork();
var elapsedTimeInMilliseconds : uint = TickTock.stop();
trace( "That took " + elapsedTimeInMilliseconds + " milliesconds" );

or in a more functional, closure-y style:

var elapsedTimeInMilliseconds : uint = TickTock.measure( function(){
  doSomeWork();
});
trace( "That took " + elapsedTimeInMilliseconds + " milliesconds" );
